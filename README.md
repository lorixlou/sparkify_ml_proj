## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
In this project, I focus on analyzing the messy and massive data from a music platform to predict the churn rate (subscription cancellation rate), and building the machine learning model (based on Random Forest Classifier, Linear Regression and Linear SVM) to find the best fitting model to predict the churn rate.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

### Pre-requirements<a name="requirement"></a>
This code is based on jupyter notebook. Python3 and Pyspark kernal is required with several packages and libraries installed.

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
### Running<a name="running"></a>

Click "run" button in jupyter notebook

## Files Description<a name="filedescription"></a>

1. Readme file: README.md
2. Jupyter Notebook file: Sparkify.ipynb
3. License file: LICENCE

## Results<a name="results"></a>

Random Forest Classifier with accuracy 0.8709677419354839 and f1-score 0.8471630486237912 comes to the best fitted model.
